# **App Name**: AI-Powered Predictive Insights

## Core Features:

- Model Integration: Integrate three pre-trained AI models (provided as files) to process incoming data. Models are loaded into memory and invoked directly.
- Second-Layer Processing: Process the outputs from the three models through a secondary pre-trained model (provided as a file) for combined analysis.
- Statistical Analysis Module: Collect and analyze statistical data from all models in the first and second layers.
- Gemini Integration: Send processed data to Gemini for final analysis and predictive output; treat Gemini as a tool that takes the stats and decides if other available info would enhance its output.
- Predictive Backend API: Create a secure and scalable backend API to manage data flow and model interactions.
- Chat Interface: Develop a user-friendly chat interface for querying results and requesting logical explanations.
- Results Display: Display model results in a clear, easy-to-understand format, including visualizations and interactive dashboards.
